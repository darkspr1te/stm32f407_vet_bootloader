# stm32f407_vet_bootloader Work in Progress

Inital commit, far from complete

This Bootloader is a replacement for the MKS series TFT screens which use stm32f407VET chips and not the 107/103 chips like in other models.

## Build Guide
Use platformio to build, 


## Binary only
can be found in buildroot/SDCARD/firmware.bin 

## Supported models
MKS TFT3.5  V1

MKS TFT3.5  V3

## UN-Supported Models
MKS TFT2.8 Any Version

MKS TFT 7 Any Version 


## foot note:-
I would not have to waste my time writing bootloaders for MKS screens if they would just release the source code, 

not that crappy attempt that they did where they dumped  broken code expecting us to all to bow to the Open sources gods,

If you want to see how it's done MKS then look at bigtreetech, but as i'am porting all your boards over to the BTT firmware 

and rewriting all the bootloaders , am saving your boards for you.
